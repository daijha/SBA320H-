Hello,  this is my final SBA ( skills Based Assessment) for my coding boot camp experience. I thought this one would be simple, but it wasn't because im still a newbie despite all that I have learned in these past months. 


SAGE REMINDERS + TECHNOLOGIES USED:
This assessment measures my ability to create a application using an API, React, css, javaScript, react router, and localStorage. Sage Reminders is an app that allows for very simple user interaction.

 How does this work? its a gentle reminder application that runs off of an advice API I found. I tried to not make it so boring, but that depends on the perspective of the user. Its calm.

HOW TO USE:
So to use it, you have two pages. Simple. You can switch between both. The links can be found in the nav bar area at the top of the page . (I may end up styling those to match the buttons for a more seamless design  too.) Under that, you are greeted with the page tittle  which tells you to simply click the "Tell me something" button, which will randomly generate some advice. Its up to you. If you like it, click the "Save this Reminder" button and when you go to the saved page, you will see a list of all your favorite pieces or advice/reminders. You can also delete the advice if you saved it by accident, if you feel different about it the next day or if it got boring and doesn't speak to your soul anymore... Its a simple app but I really hope it meets all the semi vague requirements for this exam. 


POSSIBLE FLAWS:
Once I deployed my project through Netlify , the position of my Nav bar has moved. It still works though. 

GIVE CREDIT WHERE ITS DUE:
Thanks to the Advice Slip API which you can find here:

Thanks and enjoy ( please pass me !)
